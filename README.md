# Ben Agricola

**Hi!** 👋 I'm Ben - a mostly-self-taught tinkerer and Software Engineering grad.

I dabble in Golang, Typescript, Python, Lua, bits and pieces of C and various other languages and Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, Crossplane, k8s, CF/CDK etc). CNC, 3D Printing and modelling and related areas. 

I use a lot of open-source software, and I like to contribute back to the projects that I use - as much on a personal level as a professional one. I'm not heavily involved with any in particular, but I pop up here and there with a PR or two when I find an annoyance that I think might affect others <sub><sup>(the Boy Scout Rule)</sup></sub> 👍

# Ben Agricola

**Hi!** 👋 I'm Ben - a mostly-self-taught tinkerer and Software Engineering grad (back in 2008 - time flies 🤯), and I now spend more time on the infrastructure, hosting, (dev)-ops and ☁️ side of things.

I've spent 10 years in the field professionally and had my first taste of software development and networking around 20 years ago.  

I dabble in Python, Golang, Typescript, Lua, bits and pieces of C and various other  languages and Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, k8s, CF/CDK etc). I have languages that I favour for various things, but I can generally look at code written in anything upwards of Assembly and work out what's going on.

I use a lot of open-source software at `$work`, and I like to contribute back to the projects that I use - as much on a personal level as a professional one. I'm not heavily involved with any in particular, but I pop up here and there with a PR or two when I find an annoyance that I think might affect others <sub><sup>(the Boy Scout Rule)</sup></sub> 👍


I've been working almost completely remotely for the last 18 months and have worked from 🇪🇸, 🇦🇺 and 🇳🇿, and I'm currently bunkered down in the 🇬🇧 working out what to do next 🙃

Outside of work, I'm a bit obsessed with bikes - Supermoto, Dirt bikes, Electric MX, Mountain bikes, you name it. I like to get my hands dirty and learn about things by working on them.

If I can't ride a bike I'm happy enough outdoors doing whatever (🏔and 🌲), but also like to play PC games when I have some downtime - although nowadays I run them on a `g4dn.xlarge` instance 🙈

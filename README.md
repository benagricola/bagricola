# Ben Agricola

**Hi!** üëã I'm Ben - a mostly-self-taught tinkerer and Software Engineer.

I dabble in Golang, Typescript, Python, Lua, (occasionally) C and various other languages where necessary. I have a decade of professional experience using Infrastructure-as-Code tools, from Puppet and Ansible to Terraform, Crossplane, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, AWS-CDK and Cloudformation, Serverless on Fargate etc).

More recently I've been focused on Industrial control, specifically in the CNC space, where I volunteer on the [Millennium Machines](https://github.com/MillenniumMachines) design team, helping to improve the first-cut experience of new machine operators.

I use a lot of open-source software, and I like to contribute back to the projects that I use - as much on a personal level as a professional one. I'm not heavily involved with any in particular, but I pop up here and there with a PR or two when I find an annoyance that I think might affect others <sub><sup>(the Boy Scout Rule)</sup></sub> üëç
